WyoConcerts

WyoConcerts is a single page application built with a ruby on rails backend and utilizes create-react-app for the front end. Styling was accomplished using tailwinds CSS. 

This project utilizes watir and nokogiri to scrape two established website to create and seed the data.
________________________________________________________________

Wyoming is a large state, but lacks a central location for information on live music. 

By creating a single location for this information, residents and visitors can browse concerts and venues. If a user creates an account, they have the ability to store concerts in their dashboard. 

In addition, venues can send an admin information regarding their location and concerts they are hosting. This will allow site visitors to stay informed about events around the state.
